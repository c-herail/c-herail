## About me

I am an engineering student in microelectronics and will officially graduate in October 2025 with the ISMIN diploma from Mines Saint-Ã‰tienne.

My main interests are hardware and embedded systems projects. I also enjoy expanding my knowledge in microelectronics or computer science.

## My Github projects

I use GitHub for various projects : personal, academic, and student association work.

At the moment, only the Ascon128-AEAD C implementation project is public, but I plan to add the SystemVerilog + FPGA part soon.


## Skills

Below is a list of programming languages I currently use in my projects, along with others I have worked with in past internships and older projects.
